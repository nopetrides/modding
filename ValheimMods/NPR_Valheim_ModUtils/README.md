# Mod Utilities by NoPetRides

This is a lightweight mod utlity that will encompass any shared functionality between my 
mods. Some of the methods found within are taken from the Jotunn library and I've tried to
keep naming consistent so that this library may act as a sort of "light" version of Jotunn

I will expand it as I need functionality for my own mods.
You are free to use it, but I will likely not update it beyond what is needed for mods
I am actively developing.
