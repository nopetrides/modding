# CropUtils v 0.0.1

This is my second mod. 
I wanted similar but modifed functionality found in other mods like MassFarming.

Uses BepInEx and Jotunn.

Configurables:
- Hot key for area picking 
- Hot key optional ignore type when area picking
- Range of picking (might make this admin only configurable in future)

Limitations:
- No indicator of area pickup
- Coming soon: Crop planting utils
